SquishPrint
===========

At the university we print an outrageous amount of paper materials. But we do have a heart, and try to conserve paper when we can.
Unfortunately, selecting the "2 pages per sheet" option when printing usually gives this horrible result, with way too much whitespace and text too small for comfortable perusing:

What we would rather have is this:

Fortunately, achieving the latter result is easy. Simply visit bit.ly/squishprint (where this repo is hosted) and upload any PDF.
The service will return a PDF with two pages per sheet, which can be directly printed.
